# Literature Review Methodology

## Overall Summary

In order to find as many papers that perform security and privacy attacks or defenses on XR devices, we queried Google Scholar, ACM, and IEEE libraries,  on February 1, 2023. 

For the Google Scholar search, we identified the top 60 venues we wanted to target using the Top Publications rankings from CSRankings [1]. Then, we searched through the papers published in those venues since 2015 which contained a set of terms anywhere in the document using Google Scholar's Advanced Search. This search resulted in 131 potential papers. Additionally, to find papers directly related to our topic that could have been published in any other venue, we followed the same search idea in ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Library, resulting in 319 potential papers.

From 319 potential papers, we have restricted our selection to 40 papers, listed in full_list_of_papers.md, testing practical attacks and their defenses that target XR devices' security and privacy. We further detail our literature review methodology in the subsections.
