# Literature Review Methodology

In order to find as many papers that perform security and privacy attacks or defenses on XR devices, we queried Google Scholar, ACM, and IEEE libraries,  on February 1, 2023. 

For Google Scholar search, we identified the top 60 venues we wanted to target using the Top Publications rankings from CSRankings [1]. 




Then, we searched through the papers published in those venues since 2015 which contained a set of terms anywhere in the document using Google Scholar's Advanced Search.

From 319 potential papers, we have restricted our selection to 40 papers, listed in Figure~\ref{fig:tablepapers}, testing practical attacks and their defenses that target XR devices' security and privacy. For interested readers, we detail our literature review methodology and the PRISMA 2020 guidelines followed further in the GitHub repository$^{3}$.}

 %This search resulted in 131 potential papers. Additionally, to find papers directly related to our topic that could have been published in any other venue, we followed the same search idea in ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore Library, resulting in 319 potential papers.}
 
 %\derinr{We selected the papers that fall within the scope of XR security and privacy, and we excluded the studies proposing new authentication techniques without implementing any attack on the current devices and studies that do not perform or discuss attacks or defenses that target security and privacy. For those studies, we refer the readers to the SoK papers$^{2}$. This exclusion criteria resulted in thirty-five papers. To ensure that we captured all relevant papers, we executed backward and forward citation analysis of all thirty-five papers and excluded the papers that fit into our elimination criteria. This yielded thirty-nine papers, %which is the final list of papers we have that is shown listedin Figure~\ref{fig:tablepapers}.}
