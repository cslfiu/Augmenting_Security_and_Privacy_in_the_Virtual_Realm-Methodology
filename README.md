SoK_Methodology
This repository outlines the methodology used in our Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, titled "Augmenting Security and Privacy in the Virtual Realm: An Analysis of Extended Reality Devices".

Venues Considered
We based our venue selection on data from CSRankings. Specifically, we opted for the "Engineering and Computer Science" category, a method also employed in other survey papers. Our search yielded various subcategories, from which we focused on:

Computer Security & Cryptography: Because security and privacy attacks are intrinsically linked to computer security.
Computer Graphics: As AR/VR/MR devices fundamentally rely on computer graphics.
Human-Computer Interaction: Because these devices are designed to facilitate human interaction with computer-generated environments.
Each category contained the top 20 venues, amounting to 60 venues in total for our analysis.

Phrases Considered
We designed our search phrases based on how Google Scholar's Advanced Search functions. Specifically:

Exact Phrase: For this field, we entered phrases we required to appear in the articles in the exact order specified.
With All of the Words: In this field, we entered phrases that needed to be present but not necessarily in a fixed order.
To cover all possible relevant terms, we utilized OR operations compatible with Google Scholar's Advanced Search.

Keyword Table
The table showing our search phrases (available in the Appendix) is structured around Boolean logic, combining AND and OR operations. Each phrase in the first column can be paired with phrases in the second column, connected by OR operations. This approach ensures Google Scholar returns articles containing at least one phrase from each column.

Eligibility Criteria
Our search strategy yielded 101 potential papers, which were then reviewed against our eligibility criteria. This step was manually conducted without automation tools. The criteria are:

Is the article related to the security and/or privacy of XR devices? If not, it was excluded.
Does the article only propose an authentication model without discussing potential attacks on the devices? If so, it was excluded.
These criteria alone led to the elimination of 59 papers for various reasons, including the scope limitation to XR devices and depth of content concerning attacks and defenses.
